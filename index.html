            <p>I believe the process of programming encapsulates my American Dream. My experiences and past each make up lines of code in the program, and through the combination of all those lines, my American Dream is created
                This project is a walkthrough of my American Journey, and how it shaped my American Dream.

                     Ironically, my roots in china play a part in my American Dream. Growig up in china
                     my education wasn't exactly conventional. I attended a British private school where I picked up an London accent and some British spelling practices.
                     All of this code contributes an unique background and multicultural experience.

                    He had worked hard so we can leave china and start a new life in the States. The immigration process wasn't easy. I spoke very little English and didn't know any of the culture here
                    Nonetheless, I started to adapt to life here. I attended Canyon View Elementary school, where I was quickly Americanized, and along with it I started dreaming of my American Dream.

                <p class="popup-text"> For middle school, my parents sent me to a private Jewish School. There we had to take Jewish Studies and Hebrew classes.
                     we also had to join in prayer twice a week. I am not and never had been religous, so alot of that didn't resonate with me, however the multicultural experience stayed with me.
                     by the end of middle school I have grown up in china, attended a britsh school, learned hewbrew and studied torah. I believe my values embodies the melting pot that America is,
                      and I believe that multiculturalness is a part of the American Dream

                <p class="popup-text"> Now in the present, I am a junior at Sage Hill. Our work this year centered around the American Experience and the American Dream
                    Some works we read this year was The Great Gatsby, The Awakening, and Nickel Boys. Through our reading, discussion and analysis of those books 
                    I developed a better understanding of what the American Dream is to me. A common thread among all our reading was the pursuit of freedoms and greater opportunities.
                    I have come to value those as apart of my American Dream.
